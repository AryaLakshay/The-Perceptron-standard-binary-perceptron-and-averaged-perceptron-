Part III. You are welcome to reuse code you wrote for assignment 1,
but we would like to know how you handled the following tasks.

5. How did you calculate precision, recall and F1 score? If you used a
separate script, please give the name of the script and describe how
to run it.
Ans-
1)Calculated total number of files classified correctly(Both ham and spam).
2)Total number of ham files.
3)Total number os spam files.

Using all the values above and formula from slides calculated precision, recall and F1 score.

6. How did you separate 10% of the training data? If you used a
separate script, please give the name of the script and describe how
to run it. Explain how you or your code choose the files.
Ans- I created 2 separate programs for that :
1)per_learn_10percent.py
2)avg_per_learn_10percent.py
which will count total number of files in a folder and read approximately 10% of it.
